**Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.  You may work with a timespan of your choosing. If you're really ambitious, you can merge multiple datasets from different periods. Try to provide answers to the following questions:** Chosen Period 2017

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
294,948
* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 
30.30%
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
Subscribers have increased, while customers have decreased
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
Peak hours are early morning around 8am
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
Peak hours are early morning around 8 am.
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
Bikers are predominantly male
* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the course of the past three years?
I chose 2017, but it  seems to be on the rise
* How does the average trip duration change by age?
Trip duration is greatly incrased for those born after 1990

* Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? 
24420,25603, 29502,31547
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
There seem to be a few outliers that are used much more frequently than others
**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever, you must also:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
